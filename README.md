**This SDK is compatible with Appwrite server version 0.11.x. For older versions, please check [previous releases](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-dart/releases).**

 > This is the Dart SDK for integrating with Appwrite from your Dart server-side code. If you're looking for the Flutter SDK you should check [appwrite/sdk-for-flutter](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-flutter)

Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the Dart SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools.

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  dart_appwrite: ^2.0.0
```

You can install packages from the command line:

```bash
pub get dart_appwrite
```


## Getting Started

### Initialize & Make API Request
Once you add the dependencies, its extremely easy to get started with the SDK; All you need to do is import the package in your code, set your Appwrite credentials, and start making API calls. Below is a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:dart_appwrite/dart_appwrite.dart';

void main() async {
  Client client = Client();
    .setEndpoint('http://[HOSTNAME_OR_IP]/v1') // Make sure your endpoint is accessible
    .setProject('5ff3379a01d25') // Your project ID
    .setKey('cd868c7af8bdc893b4...93b7535db89')
    .setSelfSigned() // Use only on dev mode with a self-signed SSL cert

  Users users = Users(client);

  try {
    final response = await users.create(email: ‘email@example.com’,password: ‘password’, name: ‘name’);
    print(response.data);
  } on AppwriteException catch(e) {
    print(e.message);
  }
}
```

### Error handling
The Appwrite Dart SDK raises `AppwriteException` object with `message`, `code` and `response` properties. You can handle any errors by catching `AppwriteException` and present the `message` to the user or handle it yourself based on the provided error information. Below is an example.

```dart
Users users = Users(client);

try {
  final response = await users.create(email: ‘email@example.com’,password: ‘password’, name: ‘name’);
  print(response.data);
} on AppwriteException catch(e) {
  //show message to user or do other operation based on error as required
  print(e.message);
}
```
