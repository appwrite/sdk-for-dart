**This SDK is compatible with Appwrite server version 1.8.x. For older versions, please check [previous releases](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-dart/releases).**

 > This is the Dart SDK for integrating with Appwrite from your Dart server-side code. If you're looking for the Flutter SDK you should check [appwrite/sdk-for-flutter](https://github.com/appwrite/sdk-for-flutter)

Appwrite is an open-source backend as a service server that abstract and simplify complex and repetitive development tasks behind a very simple to use REST API. Appwrite aims to help you develop your apps faster and in a more secure way. Use the Dart SDK to integrate your app with the Appwrite server to easily start interacting with all of Appwrite backend APIs and tools.

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yml
dependencies:
  dart_appwrite: ^18.0.0
```

You can install packages from the command line:

```bash
dart pub add dart_appwrite
```


## Getting Started

### Initialize & Make API Request
Once you add the dependencies, its extremely easy to get started with the SDK; All you need to do is import the package in your code, set your Appwrite credentials, and start making API calls. Below is a simple example:

```dart
Client client = Client()
  .setProject('<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>')
  .setKey('<YOUR_API_KEY>');

Users users = Users(client);

User user = await users.create(
  userId: ID.unique(),
  email: 'email@example.com',
  phone: '+123456789',
  password: 'password',
  name: 'Walter O'Brien'
);
```

### Error handling
The Appwrite Dart SDK raises `AppwriteException` object with `message`, `code` and `response` properties. You can handle any errors by catching `AppwriteException` and present the `message` to the user or handle it yourself based on the provided error information. Below is an example.

```dart
try {
  User user = await users.create(...);
} on AppwriteException catch(e) {
  // Handle the error
}
```
